HIGH LEVEL POTENTIAL FINDINGS
1. Grant language evolution: ( i.e. what terms were the most popular for each year? Which terms are no longer popular?)
2. Evolving Grant-Institution relationships: (Which universities get the most funding? Is it a power law distribution)
3. How the # of Grants each year has changed: (increase/decrease at what rate)
4. Frequent pattern mining: (association rules across terms for each year and across all years)
